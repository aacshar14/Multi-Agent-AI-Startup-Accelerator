## UX/UI Guidelines

- **Color Scheme:** Use green and blue shades to represent eco-friendliness and trust. Complement with white for readability.
- **Typography:** Sans-serif fonts for clarity and modern aesthetics. Maintain consistent hierarchy (H1, H2, body).
- **Icons:** Utilize simple, intuitive icons for navigation and actions. Ensure they are universally recognizable.
- **Spacing:** Adequate padding between elements to avoid clutter and enhance tap targets, especially on mobile devices.
- **Feedback Responses:** Provide visual feedback upon user actions (e.g., button press animations, confirmations) to enhance interactivity.
